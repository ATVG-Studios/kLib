## Reporting a Vulnerability

The best way to report Vulnerabilities is to send as much details as possible to

* Mail: [security@atvg-studios.com](mailto:security@atvg-studios.com)

ATVG-Studios will then research the issue and release a public status at both Gitlab and Github.

In the future it is expected that an Entry into the ATVG-Studios KnowledgeBase will be created.
(This depends on when the KnowledgeBase becomes available)
